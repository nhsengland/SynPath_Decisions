Therefore, a model is needed which simulates the decisions made in a pathway rather than just the data produced. </p> <p>For example, a digital twin of a heart starts by building a structural mesh, builds muscles on this mesh, and then defines how the muscles interact with one another.   It then simulates an input (electrical signals) and finally observes the blood flow measuring the rates and pressures to validate if the heart is an accurate simulation.    The model in this situation is the muscles, the inputs are electrical signals, the supply is the constraint on the size and pressure the muscles can cope with, and the output is the blood flow.</p> <p>For our interests we need to build a mesh of connected actions or pathways (akin to the muscles) as the model.  The input is then a patient need defined at the population level (ideally independent from the supply).   The constraint is the supply defined by the number of actions available per time-period.   The output is the activity and waiting times data (akin to pressure and flow in the heart). </p> <p>A scenario would take the form of changing either:</p> <p>The input need (e.g. changes to public health, initiatives and moving from treatment to earlier prevention) The model system (e.g. changes to clinical thresholds and priorities such as moving from secondary to community) The supply (e.g. changes to funding or workforce retention/recruitment questions) As none of these changes are conducted on the activity data the model is not being recursive (i.e. visualising its own assumptions) but is instead a valid simulation of the scenarios.</p> <p> </p> <ol> <li>System Service Points &amp; Activities Config<ul> <li>The system is composed of service points with activities (e.g., blood test, appointment booking) defined through clinical input.</li> <li>Activities at each point are connected to represent clinical pathways, where decisions are made dynamically based on individual interactions with thresholds.</li> <li>Each activity generates structured data (event-level) that can be aggregated to create activity tables and waiting lists.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Need Input<ul> <li>Patient need is derived from sources like ONS population data and the Bridges to Health (B2H) segmentation model to turn the population into a healthcare need.
